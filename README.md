The primary goal of this project is to leverage the rich dataset provided by CQI to understand the factors that contribute to coffee quality. Specifically, we aim to explore the following research questions:

Project Objectives : 

1.	What are the key determinants of coffee quality as evaluated through sensory attributes such as aroma, flavor, acidity, etc.?

2.	Is there a correlation between processing methods, origin regions, and coffee quality scores?

3.	Can we identify any trends or patterns in defect occurrences and their impact on overall coffee quality?

4.	How do different variables interact to influence the Total Cup Points, which represent an overall measure of coffee quality?
